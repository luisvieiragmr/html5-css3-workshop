Create a new .html file using your text editor to do your work

Hints and tips
Use the W3C HTML validator to validate your HTML; you'll get bonus points if it validates.

Block/structural semantics:

You should structure the overall document with an appropriate structure including doctype, and <html>, <head> and <body> elements.

The letter in general should be marked up with a structure of paragraphs and headings,

The names of the sender and receiver (and "Tel" and "Email") should be marked up with strong importance.

The first address and first date in the letter should be given a class attribute value of "sender-column";

There are two places where a hyperlink should be added; add appropriate links with titles. For the location that the links point to, just use http://example.com
