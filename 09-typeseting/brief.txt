General text styling:

-Give the page <body> a font-size of 10px.
-Set the <html> font to helvetica
-Give your body text a suitable line-height.
-Give your headings a little bit of letter-spacing to make them not too too squashed, and allow the letters to breathe a bit.

Links:

Give the link, visited, focus, and hover states some colors
Make it so that links are underlined by default, but when you hover or focus them, the underline disappears.
Make it so that external links have a @ symbol after them

Lists:
Give your list items a nice bullet, appropriate for the design of the page. It is up to you whether you choose a custom bullet image or something else.
